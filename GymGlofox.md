# Gym Platform — Project Brief for Claude Code

## You are working with Walid
Solo builder. Telecom engineer at du (Dubai) by day. Limited Next.js App Router experience — explain new concepts briefly when you introduce them. Direct, execution-oriented communication. Don't sugarcoat. Push back if I'm about to make a mistake.

## What we're building
Multi-tenant SaaS gym management platform for CrossFit / hybrid boutique gyms in the GCC. Pilot customer: Circle Fitness (Al Quoz, Dubai), already a paying client.

## HARD CONSTRAINTS — DO NOT VIOLATE

| # | Constraint | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **80-hour build budget to v1 demo** (~6 weeks at ~17h/week, tracked honestly per session) | Tracking — honest TBD |
| 2 | ~~**Kill switch: June 23, 2026**~~ — **LIFTED 2026-06-06.** Project continues regardless; build properly + sequence by dependency/correctness, not demo-speed-to-a-deadline | **Lifted** |
| 3 | **Circle Fitness milestone: May 26, 2026** — one of {signed monthly fee / signed IP terms / written top-5 Glofox frustrations} | ✅ **Achieved** |
| 4 | **Locked v1 scope** — only the 11 features below. Everything else defers to v2 | ✅ Closed — see v1 audit |

---

## Current status overview (scoreboard)

**As of 2026-06-06.** Read this section first; everything below is detail.

| Bucket | Status |
|---|---|
| **v1 (11 features)** | 11 ✅ all shipped — v1 complete |
| **v2 Tier 1 (revenue blockers)** | **#10 Packages on Stripe complete** ✅ (PR-1 catalog · PR-2a purchase + owner-sell · PR-2b member storefront · PR-3 entitlement — all merged to main); Tabby + mobile API deferred |
| **v2 Tier 2–13 (~95 items)** | 3 ✅ (#11 WOD programming library+calendar — incl. batch paste import, #23 1RM charts, #25 activity feed) · #21 mobile API ⬜ (deferred) · rest ⬜ |
| **Migrations** | 008–024 ✅ in repo (019 RLS hardening · 020–022 packages · 023 credit fns · 024 workout_templates). 023 + 024 applied to prod ✅. No migration pending. |
| **Next session priority** | Resume v2 Tier 2 (next wedge candidates: #12 auto-PR detection, #13 coach prep view, #16 AI parser — the AI parser would feed the batch-import preview→commit pipeline) |

## v1 audit (against the original 11-feature scope)

A fresh codebase audit on 2026-05-29 found 9 of 11 features shipped cleanly and 2 partial. The two partials must be backfilled next session before any more v2 work.

| # | v1 feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Multi-tenant schema with RLS | ✅ | `schema.sql`, `auth_box_id()` enforced on all box-scoped tables |
| 2 | Auth + roles owner/coach/athlete (magic link, no passwords) | ✅ | Supabase OTP email flow, no password field |
| 3 | Member directory (CRUD) | ✅ | Full CRUD + lead pipeline in `/dashboard/members` |
| 4 | Class template CRUD (recurring weekly) | ✅ | Full CRUD — create, edit (modal), delete, toggle-active |
| 5 | Class instance generator | ✅ | `generate-instances.ts` action with date range |
| 6 | Class booking flow | ✅ | `/dashboard/schedule` athlete page + `book-class.ts` |
| 7 | Whiteboard tablet view | ✅ | `/dashboard/whiteboard` with check-in, override modal, payment status badges |
| 8 | Daily WOD form (one per box per day) | ✅ | `UNIQUE (box_id, date)` enforced; coach types title + description + scoring type |
| 9 | Athlete 1RM tracking + percentage calculator (**THE WEDGE**) | ✅ | Structured % prescription on WOD form (lift dropdown + sets×reps@%). Whiteboard renders per-athlete kg next to each name. Athlete WOD page shows "Your loads" card. Fallback prompt when no 1RM logged. Lift catalog expanded to 29 movements. Migration 018 applied. |
| 10 | Score logging + today's leaderboard | ✅ | `workout_scores` table + activity feed view |
| 11 | Owner dashboard + manual payment tracking | ✅ | `/dashboard` overview + `/dashboard/payments` with `mark-paid` action |

### v1 backfill plan (next session)

**✅ #4 — Class template edit form** — shipped 2026-05-31. Edit button + modal on each template row. Edits name, day, time, capacity, coach.

**✅ #9 — The Wedge integration** — shipped 2026-05-31. See build log.

## v1 EXCLUSIONS (never let these creep in)
- ❌ Branded mobile app / native mobile / React Native *(now 🆕🚧 — see v2 #21 below, allowed only as API surface)*
- ❌ WhatsApp integration (Meta API approval is a rabbit hole)
- ❌ Automated billing / Stripe subscriptions *(closed in v2 #1)*
- ❌ Lead capture / CRM
- ❌ Email automation sequences
- ❌ Multi-modality (CrossFit + SGT + 1:1) — CrossFit class model only for v1
- ❌ Reporting / analytics beyond owner dashboard basics
- ❌ Member self-service signup (owner invites only)
- ❌ AI-generated programming / Codex
- ❌ Geofenced check-in
- ❌ POS / retail
- ❌ CSV / PDF import of WODs (coach types daily)
- ❌ Offline-first / sync engines
- ❌ Athlete personal-phone logging (whiteboard tablet only for v1)

## Tech stack (locked)
- Next.js 14 App Router + TypeScript
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS)
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- Vercel hosting
- @supabase/ssr for auth helpers

NO: GraphQL, Redis, custom microservices, state libraries (Zustand/Redux), tRPC, Prisma. Use Supabase client directly.

## Architectural principles
- **Multi-tenant by RLS, not application logic.** Every box-scoped table has `box_id` and an RLS policy that filters by `auth_box_id()`. Trust Postgres to enforce isolation.
- **Server Components by default.** Add `'use client'` only when interactivity demands it (forms, buttons with state, anything using hooks).
- **Weight stored in grams.** UI converts to kg/lb at render time. The `athlete_lifts.one_rm_grams` and any load values are integer grams.
- **No premature abstractions.** Build the screen, see what's repetitive, then extract. Don't pre-build component libraries.

## The wedge — why a gym switches to us
The percentage-based loading calculator. When the WOD says "5x3 @ 80% back squat", the whiteboard auto-renders the exact kg for every booked athlete based on their stored 1RM. This is what Glofox, Wodify, and SugarWOD do poorly or not at all. Polish this feature 3x more than anything else.

> ⚠️ **Currently 🚧 partial.** The calculator is built and polished as a standalone tool. Integration into WOD/whiteboard is scheduled for next-session backfill — see v1 audit above.

## Working agreement
- When I'm about to add scope, refuse first, then ask why.
- When I'm uncertain on Next.js patterns, explain the concept in 2-3 sentences before writing code.
- When you write a non-trivial chunk of code, walk me through what it does — I'm learning.
- After each task, estimate hours used vs. the 80h budget. Be honest.
- If something is taking longer than 2x estimate, stop and re-scope.

## v2 Roadmap — Priority Order

Derived from a dual audit: (a) Glofox owner-side feature inventory (parity gaps) and (b) cross-competitor sweep of Wodify, PushPress, Mindbody, ZenPlanner, SugarWOD, BTWB, TrainHeroic, Mariana Tek, Arbox (strategic wedges where Glofox is weak).

### Tag legend
- `[G-gap]` — Glofox has it, we don't. Parity feature.
- `[Wedge]` — Glofox does it badly or not at all; a competitor does it well. **Strategic — beats Glofox.**
- `[GCC]` — UAE/GCC-specific; no competitor does it well. **Greenfield local moat.**
- `[Kept]` — Existing item from the prior v2 roadmap, preserved.
- `🆕` — Scope **added after** the original v2 draft (mobile-app urgency, Packages umbrella, Tabby specifics).

### Status legend
- ✅ Shipped (merged + smoke-tested)
- 🚧 In progress / partial (some PRs done, more pending)
- 📋 Planned / spec written, ready to build
- ⏸️ Deferred — explicitly out of current scope window
- ⬜ Not started

### Recent additions / scope changes
These were added to v2 mid-flight and are tracked here so the original tier numbering stays stable:

- 🆕📋 **Packages umbrella** — one-shot purchases (PT blocks, class packs, intro offers, drop-in passes). Sold via Stripe one-shot or Tabby BNPL. Cross-references #27, #32, #76, #103. Spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-27-multi-psp-support-design.md` (extends it). Migration 018 in plan.
- 🆕📋 **Tabby BNPL adapter** — first non-Stripe PSP under #10. Replaces the original Telr-first sequencing.
- 🆕🚧 **Native mobile app (#21)** — was in Tier 3 backlog. Now prioritised: JSON API endpoints (`/api/packages/*`) land alongside the Packages PR so the mobile team can build against them.
- 🆕✅ **Security hardening** — portal token (HMAC + 7d TTL), CSP/HSTS, error sanitisation, audit log, webhook idempotency gate, refund TOCTOU fix. Sub-tasks of #7 + #10.

### Tier 1 — Revenue blockers (cannot sign a paying GCC gym without these)
1. ✅ `[Kept]` Stripe billing + subscriptions (full lifecycle: create / upgrade / downgrade / cancel)
2. ✅ `[GCC]` **UAE VAT-compliant invoicing** — 5% VAT, sequential invoice numbers, TRN on invoice, PDF export
3. ✅ `[Kept]` Digital waivers / e-signatures
4. ✅ `[G-gap]` Membership T&C e-signature at signup (distinct from liability waiver)
5. ✅ `[Wedge]` **Real-time membership validation at check-in** — whiteboard blocks unpaid athletes; shows "payment overdue" instead of letting them log
6. ✅ `[G-gap]` Refunds workflow from member profile (full / partial)
7. ✅ `[Wedge]` **Smart dunning + failed-card recovery** — auto-retry, member self-serve update link, mark `past_due` after N retries
8. ✅ `[Kept]` Automated billing reminders (email/SMS on due / overdue)
9. ✅ `[GCC]` **PDPL data export per member** — UAE Federal Decree-Law 45 of 2021 compliance
10. 🚧 `[Wedge][GCC]` **Multi-PSP + Packages** — PSP port PR-1 ✅ done (Stripe adapter, provider-agnostic columns). **Re-scoped 2026-06-06** (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-06-packages-design.md`): next work is **Packages** — one-shot, credit-based products (class packs / drop-ins / PT blocks) on **Stripe**, in 3 sub-PRs:
    - **Packages-PR1** ✅ owner catalog + data model (migrations 020–022, `validatePackageInput` + tests) — PR #2.
    - **Packages-PR2a** ✅ purchase backend + owner-sell (merged to main): one-shot `createPackageCheckout`, webhook grants `package_credits` + VAT invoice, owner sell-package action + member-profile UI. No migration.
    - **Packages-PR2b** ✅ member self-serve storefront + "my credits" (merged to main): `/dashboard/shop` page, `buyPackage` self-action (athlete-only), athlete "Buy a pack" nav. Reuses PR-2a backend — no migration/webhook change.
    - **Packages-PR3** ✅ booking entitlement (merged to main): pure `credits.ts` precedence (`selectBestBatch`/`decideEntitlement`), migration 023 atomic `consume_credit`/`refund_credit` fns, hard-gate consume in `book-class`, refund in `cancel-booking`, credit clause in `check-in`, owner PT `redeem-session`, whiteboard "Pack" badge + buy-a-pack link. Plan `…packages-pr3-entitlement.md`.
    - Deferred: Tabby BNPL adapter, `/api/packages/*` mobile API, original Telr/Tap/NI/PayTabs adapters, real-gym pilot.

### Tier 2 — The wedge: CrossFit programming layer (beats Glofox, matches Wodify/SugarWOD/BTWB)

No migration (writes existing `workouts`). Single-track (multi-track = #17), drag-drop + AI parse (#16) deferred. Migration 024. Plans `…2026-06-07-wod-programming.md`, `…2026-06-07-batch-wod-import.md`.

## How to use this document

- **What should I build next?** → Check "Current status overview" → see "Next session priority" (currently v1 Wedge backfill).
- **Is X in scope for v1?** → Search the v1 audit table. If not there, it's v2.
- **What tier does X belong to?** → Scan Tier headings; cross-check tags `[Wedge]` `[GCC]` `[G-gap]`.
- **Did we ship X already?** → Check the Build Log + the ✅/🚧 emoji on the relevant item.
- **Is X new scope (not in the original draft)?** → Look for `🆕` tag on the item or in the "Recent additions" subsection.
